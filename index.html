That is precisely the situation a player found themselves in. But this isn't just about one frustrated player's holiday quest - it's a window into a broader pattern of disconnection.</p>
                        
                        <p>In Wikispeedia, players chase connections between ideas, but sometimes these paths vanish unexpectedly. What starts as an engaging puzzle can become a dead end, revealing gaps in our digital knowledge network that mirror gaps in how we connect concepts.</p>

                        <p>Navigating Wikispeedia should feel intuitive and rewarding, yet many users encounter moments of frustration that disrupt their experience. Embedded within our dataset are subtle yet telling behaviors that collectively reveal the underlying struggles of users.</p>

                            <h3>The Human Side of Digital Frustration</h3>
                            <p>Frustration in Wikispeedia isn't just about failed navigationâ€”it's a deeply human experience. When players start their journey, they're driven by anticipation and the promise of reward, their brains ready for the satisfaction of finding the right path. But as they encounter dead ends and missing links, this optimism transforms into a cocktail of stress hormones.</p>
                            
                            <p>They begin with excitement, dopamine driving their pursuit. As they navigate through "Winter" and reach "Santa Claus," initial confidence turns to confusion. When the expected link to "Christmas" isn't there, cortisol levels rise, and adrenaline kicks inâ€”the body's natural "fight or flight" response to an increasingly frustrating situation. What started as an engaging puzzle becomes a source of genuine emotional stress, leading many players to eventually abandon their quest.</p>
                        </div>

                        <p>Frustration manifests not just in what users do, but in how they deviate from expected pathways. Backtracking, for instance, serves as a clear signalâ€”a tacit acknowledgment by users that the current route feels insufficient or misleading.</p>

                        <p class="lead">These recurring patterns of visibly frustrated user behavior stem from the fact that there seem to be unexpected dead-ends and unreachable targets. A simple analysis of the pages at which players backtrack most often shows that backtracking is associated with closely related concepts not being linked together in the hyperlink network.</p>
                        <p>Upon close inspection of certain paths, we notice that some target articles do not exist at all, forcing the user to repeatedly think they are very close to the target, only to find themselves having to backtrack.</p>
                        <p> For example, the most frequent backtrack in our dataset is from "Soybean" when "Bean" is the target, with 111 recorded backtracks.</p>

                        <p>As we can see, there is a big cluster containing most of the articles that can be mutually reached. But there is still more than 500 articles (around 12%) that are either not reachable from any other article or that can't reach most articles.</p>

                        <p>Our goal is to make every article reachable from any starting point, enhancing the game's playability while preserving its core challenge.

                        <p>Let's revisit our table of most frequent backtracks. The most common frustration point occurs between "Soybean" and "Bean", with 111 recorded backtracks. This suggests a missing connection that should be obvious to users.</p>
                        
                        <p>Looking at the actual content of the Soybean article, we find something interesting:</p>

                        <p>The word "bean" explicitly appears in the article, yet there's no hyperlink to the Bean page!

                            <p>Using this insight, we developed a systematic approach: add a link between articles when:</p>

                        <p>While this improvement is modest - only 49 additional articles became reachable - it confirms our hypothesis that some disconnected articles are semantically related and referenced within each other.

                        <p>This approach dramatically improved connectivity, but at a severe cost: it added 372,813 new linksâ€”more than quintupling the total number of connections in the network. Such a dense web of links would fundamentally change the nature of Wikispeedia, making it too easy to find connections and removing the creative challenge that makes the game engaging.</p>
                        
                        <p>This reveals an important tension in our mission: while we want to make the game more accessible by eliminating impossible paths, we must be careful not to sacrifice the core gameplay experience that makes Wikispeedia both challenging and rewarding.</p>

                        <p>But is it even possible to make every article reachable from any starting point? Maybe there is an article that is so specific that it would make no sense to even try to connect it to other articles. To elucidate this, we decided to plot the embeddings of all articles (by reducing the dimensionality of the embeddings to 2 dimensions using t-SNE) and see if there are any completely isolated articles, especially words that are not in the main cluster.</p>

                        <p>Interestingly, the visualization reveals that there are no truly semantically isolated articles - even the currently disconnected articles (shown in red) are semantically similar to some connected articles (in blue), as evidenced by their proximity in the semantic space. This suggests that the current disconnections in the network are more a result of missing links rather than fundamental semantic incompatibility between articles.</p>
                        <p>To be able to connect all articles, we devised an algoorithm that would, at each step, add a link between the isolated article that is the most similar to any article in the main cluster and this article of the main cluster. So the selected article (and articles connected to it) would now be part of the main cluster. We repeated this process until all articles were connected.</p>

What's particularly impressive is that we achieved this with only 525 carefully chosen additional links - a mere fraction of the potential connections we could have added.</p>
                        
                        <p>The single green circle in the graph, labeled "4604", represents this unified network where all articles are mutually accessible.

                        <p>The highest-similarity connections are extremely intuitive - many are simply different names for the same concept or closely related species. These links are so natural that their absence from the original network seems more like an oversight than a deliberate choice.</p>

                        <p>Even the lower-similarity connections maintain some logical relationship - they connect articles within similar domains (literature, medical conditions, economic policy) while still requiring players to think creatively about the connections. This preserves the game's challenge while eliminating truly impossible paths.</p>

                        <p>It's important to note that these limitations in connectivity are partly due to the nature of the dataset itself. Wikispeedia uses only a small subset of Wikipedia articles, which means that many potential intermediate articles that could provide more natural connections are simply not available in the game. For instance, while "Romeo and Juliet" and "Julius and Ethel Rosenberg" might be better connected through articles about "Famous couples" or "Tragic love stories", such bridging articles are not part of the Wikispeedia dataset.</p>

                            To truly understand how our fixes reshape the semantic landscape of Wikispeedia, we've created something special: a three-dimensional visualization of the article network in semantic space. By projecting each article into this space using embedding techniques, we can literally see how concepts cluster and connect. Watch as previously isolated articles find their natural homes in the semantic constellation, and witness how our carefully crafted links bridge the conceptual chasms that once frustrated players.

            <p>
                This website presents the findings of our Applied Data Analysis (CS-401) project at EPFL. 
                Using data from Wikispeedia, we analyzed how players navigate between Wikipedia articles, 
                focusing on understanding patterns of user frustration and identifying missing semantic connections.
